# 🕵️‍♀️ Warranty Claims Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on identifying potential fraudulent warranty claims by building and evaluating machine learning models. Detecting fraud in warranty claims helps companies reduce financial losses and maintain trust with legitimate customers.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Warranty fraud poses a significant challenge in the manufacturing and service industries. False claims cost companies millions annually and reduce trust in support systems. The goal of this project is to analyze historical warranty data and develop models that can classify whether a claim is **legitimate** or **fraudulent**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Load and explore the warranty claims dataset
- Preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features
- Build and evaluate multiple classification models
- Interpret model results and identify key fraud indicators
- Visualize insights for better communication and understanding

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest 
- **Other:** Jupyter Notebook, Git

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key visualizations include:
- Distribution of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent claims
- Relationships
- Feature correlations to detect multicollinearity
- Feature importance from tree-based models

## 🤖 Model Building & Evaluation

| Model                   | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 92%      |
|Random Forest    | 92%      |
| Decision Tree Classifier| 93%      |

> 📌 Decision Tree Classifier demonstrated better generalization and interpretability for fraud detection in this case.

## 🧠 Skills Learned

Through this project, I gained experience with:

- **Data Cleaning & Encoding**  
  Handling inconsistencies and preparing categorical data for modeling.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Creating meaningful inputs such as average claim amount per user or claim frequency.

- **Model Evaluation & Comparison**  
  Using metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices to assess models.

- **Understanding Imbalanced Datasets**  
  Learning about class imbalance and potential techniques for future enhancement (e.g., SMOTE, stratified sampling).

- **Practical Application of ML**  
  Applying models in a real-world business context where financial and reputational risks are involved.

## ✅ Conclusions

- ML models can help automate the detection of suspicious claims with high accuracy.
- Data quality and domain-specific features are crucial for performance in fraud detection.
